# LiteLocalization
A simple, lightweight text localization system for Unity.

> I decided to write a simple text localization system for my small projects because the solution from Unity or any assets from the asset store seemed too cumbersome to me. I don't guarantee continuous repository support or avoiding breaking changes.

Requirements: `Unity 2021+`, `.NET Standard 2.1`.
